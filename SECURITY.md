# Security Policy

Always ensure that you are on the latest version for optimal security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please encrypt it with my PGP key ([you can find it on Keybase here](https://keybase.io/doamatto)) and send an email with the nature of the issue and how to reproduce the bug, as well as any reproducibility information you've already found to `hello@doamatto.xyz`. Please include in the subject line `[Security issue for Steam Game Randomizer]`.

Once you file a report, give me around 24-to-48 hours to respond letting you know if I can reproduce or not. I will do my best to fix any and all bugs, especially ones related to security issues. If I deem the issue to be severe enough, I may request your PayPal email address to compensate you for finding an issue. Otherwise, you will simply be included in the README as someone who fixed a severe bug.

When a bug is reported and approved to be an issue, notice of this issue will be in [the security advisories section of this repository here.](https://github.com/doamatto/steam-game-randomizer/security/advisories)
